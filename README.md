# Technical training Odoo

Here is the technical training for Odoo, as shown in [Odoo developer tutorials](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/developer/tutorials/getting_started/01_architecture.html), and advanced topics.

The _Getting Started_ sections will have only one PR from a branch called
`16.0-state-gs#-suavesito-olimpiada`, where `gs` stands for Getting Started and
`#` is the number of section.
